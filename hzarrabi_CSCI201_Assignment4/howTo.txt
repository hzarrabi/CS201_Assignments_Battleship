Each player gets a board with two grids, five ships, 
and a bunch of hit and miss markers.

Goal: To sink all of your opponent's 
ships by correctly guessing their location.

Play

Players take turns firing a shot to attack enemy ships.

On your turn, call out a letter and a number of a 
row and column on the grid. Your opponent checks 
that space on their lower grid, and says "miss" 
if there are no ships there, or "hit" if you 
guessed a space that contained a ship.

Mark your shots on your upper grid, with 
white pegs for misses and red pegs for 
hits, to keep track of your guesses.

When one of your ships is hit, put a 
red peg into that ship on your lower 
grid at the location of the hit. 
Whenever one of your ships has every 
slot filled with red pegs, you must 
announce to your opponent that he has 
sunk your ship.

Victory: The first player to sink all opposing ships wins.
